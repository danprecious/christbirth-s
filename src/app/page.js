            It is my greatest pleasure to write this to you. In you, I've found
            peace and joy; you've been a profound influence in my life, my alter
            ego. You are a very special friend that i cherish. I just want to
            wish you a very happy birthday and pray that this day brings you
            endless joy and blessings. I love you so much babe, and I pray God
            keeps us together through any trials we may face. God bless you
            always.{" "}
